# Snow
What is Snow? Snow is a free but simple CSS framework I am working on developing. What sets snow appart from other frameworks like 
bootstrap and larval, is well, I made it. 

## Get Started
It's as simple as just a drag and drop

Step 1:
Download the Snow GitHub Repository. Do this by clicking the green Code button and saving to the desktop with GIT or downloading as a ZIP

Step 2:
Place the whole css, js, and img file into your public_html directory or where your main website directory is.

Step 3:
As long as your html and css files are in the main directory, link them using this code:
```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/snow.css"> <!--Link to the Snow CSS file-->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">q
```

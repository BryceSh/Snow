# Snow
What is Snow? Snow is a free but simple CSS framework I am working on developing. What sets snow appart from other frameworks like 
bootstrap and larval, is well, I made it. 

## Get Started
It's as simple as just a drag and drop

Step 1:<br>
Download or clone the Git repository<br>
`git clone https://github.com/BryceSh/Snow.git`

Step 2:<br>
Once you've downloaded all of the files to your website directory, just drag and drop all of the files into your websites main directory. For most people with will be `public_html` or if your website has a different directory, just place those files there.

Step 3:<br>
Once you've completed all of the steps above, you can link all of the files you need by coping and pasting this into your `<head>` tag within your file.
```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/snow.css"> <!--Link to the Snow CSS file-->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">
```
<br>
Step 4:<br>
Code away and have fun!<br>
